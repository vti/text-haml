0.990117 2016-04-25T09:25:07Z

    All changes by Mark Aufflick.

    [Improvements]
    - Added test to ensure sequential multiline code blocks work
    - Since we no longer allow statement continuation across `-` code block lines, implemented support for multiline
      code blocks.
    - Fair attempt at block capturing helpers
    - Now bracing whole level, including blocks which is a precursor to allowing helpers to enclose blocks
    - Need implicit braces around block contents also
    - Eliminate need for closing brace block by implicitly adding open/close braces at level changes

    [Fixes]
    - Fixed regression introduced by implicit bracing where final trailing newlines were no longer suppressed where they
      should have been.
    - Fixed bogus <> and </> from wrapping lines beginning with ( or {
