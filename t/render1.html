        <h2>Quick Notes</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Text::Haml is usually indented with two spaces,
            although more than two is allowed.
            You have to be consistent, though.
          </li>
          <li>
            The first character of any line is called
            the &quot;control character&quot; - it says &quot;make a tag&quot;
            or &quot;run Ruby code&quot; or all sorts of things.
          </li>
          <li>
            Text::Haml takes care of nicely indenting your HTML.
          </li>
          <li>
            Text::Haml allows Ruby code and blocks.
            But not in this example.
            We turned it off for security.
          </li>
        </ul>

        You can get more information by reading the
        <a href='/docs/yardoc/HAML_REFERENCE.md.html'>
          Official Text::Haml Reference

        <p>
          This example doesn&apos;t allow Ruby to be executed,
          but real Text::Haml does.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ruby code is included by using = at the
          beginning of a line.
